  <p>The second generation (1959-1965) was the era of the transistor computers. These computers used transistors which were cheap, compact and consuming less power; it made transistor computers faster than the first generation computers.
    In this generation, magnetic cores were used as the primary memory and magnetic disc and tapes were used as the secondary storage. Assembly language and programming languages like COBOL and FORTRAN, and Batch processing and multiprogramming operating systems were used in these computers.
    
    Some of the popular second generation computers are;</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>IBM 1620</b></li>
   <li><b> IBM 7094 </b></li>
   <li><b> CDC 1604</b></li>
   <li> <b>CDC 3600</b></li>
   <li><b> UNIVAC 1108 </b></li>
